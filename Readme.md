# Project Title: Sentiment Analysis

## Description:
Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is the process of computationally determining the emotional tone or opinion expressed in a piece of text, such as a tweet or product review. It involves analyzing text to determine whether the sentiment conveyed is positive, negative, or neutral. By performing sentiment analysis, we gain insights into the opinions, attitudes, and emotions of individuals towards specific topics or products.

This project aims to implement sentiment analysis using machine learning techniques to classify text data into different sentiment categories. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict the sentiment expressed in text data, allowing us to understand the overall sentiment trends and sentiments associated with various topics or products.
